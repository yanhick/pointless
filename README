Tech description
- mainly client-side code, back-end just used as DB and ID generator
- user enters the site either with empty url, in which case an ID is generated for him and he is 
redirected to this URL.
- client-code starts by calling a back-end endpoint returning the currently saved document for the presentation
- once fetched
    - JSON doc parsed and rendered
    - JSON contain a css style sheet. It is added as a style node with a data-attribute so that it can be updated
    when the user edits the styles of the stylesheet
    - JSON contains an html template. For each content item, render it by replacing a few attribute

Example Json :

{
    html : "<div class="slide"></div>",
    css : "ul {}",
    content : [{
        text : "Lorem Ipsum",
        image : "img url"
    },
    {
        text : "Lorem Ipsum",
        image : "img url"
    }]
}



- when user changes slide with left/right arrow
    - clean slides to remove empty ones
    - if new index < 0, do nothing
    - if new index == nbSlides, add new slide
    - if new index > nbSlides, new index == nbSlides 
    - refresh UI
